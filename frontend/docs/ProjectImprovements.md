### ðŸ’Ž Skill Match Indicator

The Skill Match Indicator offers applicants and managers insight into job compatibility by showing a match percentage between the applicantâ€™s skills and the skills preferred for the job. This feature provides a more tailored hiring process by displaying common skills shared between applicants and job requirements. This visual match indicator allows applicants to prioritize applications for jobs where their skill set aligns well, while helping managers filter applicants more effectively.

### ðŸ’Ž Filtering Based on Part-Time or Full-Time

We introduced a job type filtering system in the `JobsListView` for users to easily filter job listings based on the typeâ€”either all jobs, part-time, or full-time positions. This enhancement allows applicants to search for jobs that fit their availability and interest level. The filter buttons are highlighted to indicate the active filter, and the feature leverages `useMemo` for optimized performance, ensuring an efficient and user-friendly experience.
